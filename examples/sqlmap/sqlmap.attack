Feature: Run sqlmap against a target
  # See:
  #   https://github.com/sqlmapproject/sqlmap/wiki/Usage

Scenario: Identify SQL injection vulnerabilities
  Given "sqlmap" is installed
  And the following environment variables:
    | name       | environment_variable_name |
    | target_url | SQLMAP_TARGET |
  When I launch a "sqlmap" attack with:
    """
    python <sqlmap_path> -u <target_url> --dbms mysql --batch -v 0 --tables
    """
  Then the output should contain:
    """
    sqlmap identified the following injection points
    """
  And the output should contain:
    """
    [2 tables]
    +-----------------+
    | numbers         |
    | sqlite_sequence |
    +-----------------+
    """
